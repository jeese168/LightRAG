# ABSTRACT

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models(LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate andcontextually relevant responses tailored to user needs. However, existing RAGsystems have significant limitations, including reliance on flat data representa-tions and inadequate contextual awareness, which can lead to fragmented answersthat fail to capture complex inter-dependencies. To address these challenges, wepropose LightRAG, which incorporates graph structures into text indexing andretrieval processes. This innovative framework employs a dual-level retrieval sys-tem that enhances comprehensive information retrieval from both low-level andhigh-level knowledge discovery. Additionally, the integration of graph structureswith vector representations facilitates efficient retrieval of related entities and theirrelationships, significantly improving response times while maintaining contextualrelevance. This capability is further enhanced by an incremental update algorithmthat ensures the timely integration of new data, allowing the system to remaineffective and responsive in rapidly changing data environments. Extensive experi-mental validation demonstrates considerable improvements in retrieval accuracyand efficiency compared to existing approaches.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have been developed to enhance large languagemodels (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources Sudhi et al. (2024); Es et al. (2024);Salemi & Zamani (2024). This innovative integration allows LLMs to generate more accurate andcontextually relevant responses, significantly improving their utility in real-world applications. Byadapting to specific domain knowledge Tu et al. (2024), RAG systems ensure that the informationprovided is not only pertinent but also tailored to the user’s needs. Furthermore, they offer access toup-to-date information Zhao et al. (2024), which is crucial in rapidly evolving fields. Chunking playsa vital role in facilitating the retrieval-augmented generation process Lyu et al. (2024). By breakingdown a large external text corpus into smaller, more manageable segments, chunking significantlyenhances the accuracy of information retrieval. This approach allows for more targeted similaritysearches, ensuring that the retrieved content is directly relevant to user queries.

However, existing RAG systems have key limitations that hinder their performance. First, manymethods rely on flat data representations, restricting their ability to understand and retrieve informationbased on intricate relationships between entities. Second, these systems often lack the contextualawareness needed to maintain coherence across various entities and their interrelations, resultingin responses that may not fully address user queries. For example, consider a user asking, “Howdoes the rise of electric vehicles influence urban air quality and public transportation infrastructure?”Existing RAG methods might retrieve separate documents on electric vehicles, air pollution, andpublic transportation challenges but struggle to synthesize this information into a cohesive response.They may fail to explain how the adoption of electric vehicles can improve air quality, which in turn

could affect public transportation planning. As a result, the user may receive a fragmented answerthat does not adequately capture the complex inter-dependencies among these topics.

To address these limitations, we propose incorporating graph structures into text indexing andrelevant information retrieval. Graphs are particularly effective at representing the interdependenciesamong different entities Rampášek et al. (2022), which enables a more nuanced understandingof relationships. The integration of graph-based knowledge structures facilitates the synthesis ofinformation from multiple sources into coherent and contextually rich responses. Despite theseadvantages, developing a fast and scalable graph-empowered RAG system that efficiently handlesvarying query volumes is crucial. In this work, we achieve an effective and efficient RAG system byaddressing three key challenges: i) Comprehensive Information Retrieval. Ensuring comprehensiveinformation retrieval that captures the full context of inter-dependent entities from all documents;ii) Enhanced Retrieval Efficiency. Improving retrieval efficiency over the graph-based knowledgestructures to significantly reduce response times; iii) Rapid Adaptation to New Data. Enablingquick adaptation to new data updates, ensuring the system remains relevant in dynamic environments.

In response to the outlined challenges, we propose LightRAG, a model that seamlessly integrates agraph-based text indexing paradigm with a dual-level retrieval framework. This innovative approachenhances the system’s capacity to capture complex inter-dependencies among entities, resulting inmore coherent and contextually rich responses. LightRAG employs efficient dual-level retrievalstrategies: low-level retrieval, which focuses on precise information about specific entities and theirrelationships, and high-level retrieval, which encompasses broader topics and themes. By combiningboth detailed and conceptual retrieval, LightRAG effectively accommodates a diverse range of quries,ensuring that users receive relevant and comprehensive responses tailored to their specific needs.Additionally, by integrating graph structures with vector representations, our framework facilitatesefficient retrieval of related entities and relations while enhancing the comprehensiveness of resultsthrough relevant structural information from the constructed knowledge graph.

In summary, the key contributions of this work are highlighted as follows:

• General Aspect. We emphasize the importance of developing a graph-empowered RAG system toovercome the limitations of existing methods. By integrating graph structures into text indexing,we can effectively represent complex interdependencies among entities, fostering a nuancedunderstanding of relationships and enabling coherent, contextually rich responses.

• Methodologies. To enable an efficient and adaptive RAG system, we propose LightRAG, whichintegrates a dual-level retrieval paradigm with graph-enhanced text indexing. This approachcaptures both low-level and high-level information for comprehensive, cost-effective retrieval.By eliminating the need to rebuild the entire index, LightRAG reduces computational costs andaccelerates adaptation, while its incremental update algorithm ensures timely integration of newdata, maintaining effectiveness in dynamic environments.

• Experimental Findings. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness ofLightRAG in comparison to existing RAG models. These assessments focused on several keydimensions, including retrieval accuracy, model ablation, response efficiency, and adaptability tonew information. The results demonstrated significant improvements over baseline methods.

# 2 RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates user queries with a collection of pertinent doc-uments sourced from an external knowledge database, incorporating two essential elements: theRetrieval Component and the Generation Component. 1) The retrieval component is responsiblefor fetching relevant documents or information from the external knowledge database. It identifies andretrieves the most pertinent data based on the input query. 2) After the retrieval process, the generationcomponent takes the retrieved information and generates coherent, contextually relevant responses. Itleverages the capabilities of the language model to produce meaningful outputs. Formally, this RAGframework, denoted as $\mathcal { M }$ , can be defined as follows:

$$
\mathcal {M} = \left(\mathcal {G}, \mathcal {R} = (\varphi , \psi)\right), \quad \mathcal {M} (q; \mathcal {D}) = \mathcal {G} \left(q, \psi (q; \hat {\mathcal {D}})\right), \quad \hat {\mathcal {D}} = \varphi (\mathcal {D}) \tag {1}
$$

In this framework, $\mathcal { G }$ and $\mathcal { R }$ represent the generation module and the retrieval module, respectively,while $q$ denotes the input query and $D$ refers to the external database. The retrieval module $\mathcal { R }$

![image](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2026-03-14/0f13e529-2349-4804-b99a-0a2efd0d2847/7a59e58f19abc9909e42784910b6ed976e3ab0e48c5fdbeac8470bf0d3bb8f2b.jpg)

includes two key functionalities: i) Data Indexer $\varphi ( \cdot )$ : which involves building a specific datastructure $\hat { \mathcal { D } }$ based on the external database $D$ . ii) Data Retriever $\psi ( \cdot )$ : The relevant documents areobtained by comparing the query against the indexed data, also denoted as “relevant documents”. Byleveraging the information retrieved through $\psi ( \cdot )$ along with the initial query $q$ , the generative model$\mathcal { G } ( \cdot )$ efficiently produces high-quality, contextually relevant responses.

In this work, we target several key points essential for an efficient and effective Retrieval-AugmentedGeneration (RAG) system which are elaborated below:

• Comprehensive Information Retrieval: The indexing function $\varphi ( \cdot )$ must be adept at extractingglobal information, as this is crucial for enhancing the model’s ability to answer queries effectively.

• Efficient and Low-Cost Retrieval: The indexed data structure $\hat { \mathcal { D } }$ must enable rapid and cost-efficient retrieval to effectively handle a high volume of queries.

• Fast Adaptation to Data Changes: The ability to swiftly and efficiently adjust the data structureto incorporate new information from the external knowledge base, is crucial for ensuring that thesystem remains current and relevant in an ever-changing information landscape.

# 3 THE LIGHTRAG ARCHITECTURE

# 3.1 GRAPH-BASED TEXT INDEXING

Graph-Enhanced Entity and Relationship Extraction. Our LightRAG enhances the retrievalsystem by segmenting documents into smaller, more manageable pieces. This strategy allows forquick identification and access to relevant information without analyzing entire documents. Next,we leverage LLMs to identify and extract various entities (e.g., names, dates, locations, and events)along with the relationships between them. The information collected through this process will beused to create a comprehensive knowledge graph that highlights the connections and insights acrossthe entire collection of documents. We formally represent this graph generation module as follows:

$$
\hat {\mathcal {D}} = (\hat {\mathcal {V}}, \hat {\mathcal {E}}) = \operatorname {D e d u p e} \circ \operatorname {P r o f} (\mathcal {V}, \mathcal {E}), \quad \mathcal {V}, \mathcal {E} = \cup_ {\mathcal {D} _ {i} \in \mathcal {D}} \operatorname {R e c o g} \left(\mathcal {D} _ {i}\right) \tag {2}
$$

where $\hat { \mathcal { D } }$ represents the resulting knowledge graphs. To generate this data, we apply three mainprocessing steps to the raw text documents $\mathcal { D } _ { i }$ . These steps utilize a LLM for text analysis andprocessing. Details about the prompt templates and specific settings for this part can be found inAppendix 7.3.2. The functions used in our graph-based text indexing paradigm are described as:

• Extracting Entities and Relationships. $\mathsf { R } ( \cdot )$ : This function prompts a LLM to identify entities(nodes) and their relationships (edges) within the text data. For instance, it can extract entitieslike "Cardiologists" and "Heart Disease," and relationships such as "Cardiologists diagnose HeartDisease" from the text: "Cardiologists assess symptoms to identify potential heart issues." Toimprove efficiency, the raw text $\mathcal { D }$ is segmented into multiple chunks $\mathcal { D } _ { i }$ .

• LLM Profiling for Key-Value Pair Generation. $\mathrm { P } ( \cdot )$ : We employ a LLM-empowered profilingfunction, $\mathrm { P } ( \cdot )$ , to generate a text key-value pair $( K , V )$ for each entity node in $\nu$ and relationedge in $\mathcal { E }$ . Each index key is a word or short phrase that enables efficient retrieval, while thecorresponding value is a text paragraph summarizing relevant snippets from external data to aid intext generation. Entities use their names as the sole index key, whereas relations may have multipleindex keys derived from LLM enhancements that include global themes from connected entities.

• Deduplication to Optimize Graph Operations. $\mathrm { D } ( \cdot )$ : Finally, we implement a deduplicationfunction, $\mathrm { D } ( \cdot )$ , that identifies and merges identical entities and relations from different segments of

the raw text $\mathcal { D } _ { i }$ . This process effectively reduces the overhead associated with graph operations on$\hat { \mathcal { D } }$ by minimizing the graph’s size, leading to more efficient data processing.

Our LightRAG offers two advantages through its graph-based text indexing paradigm. First, Com-prehensive Information Understanding. The constructed graph structures enable the extractionof global information from multi-hop subgraphs, greatly enhancing LightRAG’s ability to handlecomplex queries that span multiple document chunks. Second, Enhanced Retrieval Performance.the key-value data structures derived from the graph are optimized for rapid and precise retrieval.This provides a superior alternative to less accurate embedding matching methods (Gao et al., 2023)and inefficient chunk traversal techniques (Edge et al., 2024) commonly used in existing approaches.

Fast Adaptation to Incremental Knowledge Base. To efficiently adapt to evolving data changeswhile ensuring accurate and relevant responses, our LightRAG incrementally updates the knowledgebase without the need for complete reprocessing of the entire external database. For a new document$\mathcal { D } ^ { \prime }$ , the incremental update algorithm processes it using the same graph-based indexing steps $\varphi$ asbefore, resulting in $\hat { \mathcal { D } ^ { \prime } } = ( \hat { \mathcal { V } } ^ { \prime } , \hat { \mathcal { E } ^ { \prime } } )$ . Subsequently, LightRAGcombines the new graph data with theoriginal by taking the union of the node sets $\hat { \mathcal { V } }$ and $\hat { \mathcal { V } } ^ { \prime }$ , as well as the edge sets $\hat { \mathcal { E } }$ and $\hat { \mathcal { E } } ^ { \prime }$ .

Two key objectives guide our approach to fast adaptation for the incremental knowledge base: Seam-less Integration of New Data. By applying a consistent methodology to new information, theincremental update module allows the LightRAG to integrate new external databases without disrupt-ing the existing graph structure. This approach preserves the integrity of established connections,ensuring that historical data remains accessible while enriching the graph without conflicts or redun-dancies. Reducing Computational Overhead . By eliminating the need to rebuild the entire indexgraph, this method reduces computational overhead and facilitates the rapid assimilation of new data.Consequently, LightRAG maintains system accuracy, provides current information, and conservesresources, ensuring users receive timely updates and enhancing the overall RAG effectiveness.

# 3.2 DUAL-LEVEL RETRIEVAL PARADIGM

To retrieve relevant information from both specific document chunks and their complex inter-dependencies, our LightRAG proposes generating query keys at both detailed and abstract levels.

• Specific Queries. These queries are detail-oriented and typically reference specific entities withinthe graph, requiring precise retrieval of information associated with particular nodes or edges. Forexample, a specific query might be, “Who wrote ’Pride and Prejudice’?”

• Abstract Queries. In contrast, abstract queries are more conceptual, encompassing broader topics,summaries, or overarching themes that are not directly tied to specific entities. An example of anabstract query is, “How does artificial intelligence influence modern education?”

To accommodate diverse query types, the LightRAG employs two distinct retrieval strategies withinthe dual-level retrieval paradigm. This ensures that both specific and abstract inquiries are addressedeffectively, allowing the system to deliver relevant responses tailored to user needs.

• Low-Level Retrieval. This level is primarily focused on retrieving specific entities along with theirassociated attributes or relationships. Queries at this level are detail-oriented and aim to extractprecise information about particular nodes or edges within the graph.

• High-Level Retrieval. This level addresses broader topics and overarching themes. Queries at thislevel aggregate information across multiple related entities and relationships, providing insightsinto higher-level concepts and summaries rather than specific details.

Integrating Graph and Vectors for Efficient Retrieval. By combining graph structures withvector representations, the model gains a deeper insight into the interrelationships among entities.This synergy enables the retrieval algorithm to effectively utilize both local and global keywords,streamlining the search process and improving the relevance of results.

• (i) Query Keyword Extraction. For a given query $q$ , the retrieval algorithm of LightRAG beginsby extracting both local query keywords $k ^ { ( l ) }$ and global query keywords $k ^ { ( g ) }$ .

• (ii) Keyword Matching. The algorithm uses an efficient vector database to match local querykeywords with candidate entities and global query keywords with relations linked to global keys.

• (iii) Incorporating High-Order Relatedness. To enhance the query with higher-order relatedness,LightRAGfurther gathers neighboring nodes within the local subgraphs of the retrieved graphelements. This process involves the set $\{ v _ { i } | v _ { i } \in \mathcal { V } \wedge ( v _ { i } \in \mathcal { N } _ { v } \vee \bar { v } _ { i } \in \mathcal { N } _ { e } ) \}$ , where $\mathcal { N } _ { v }$ and $\mathcal { N } _ { e }$represent the one-hop neighboring nodes of the retrieved nodes $v$ and edges $e$ , respectively.

This dual-level retrieval paradigm not only facilitates efficient retrieval of related entities and relationsthrough keyword matching, but also enhances the comprehensiveness of results by integrating relevantstructural information from the constructed knowledge graph.

# 3.3 RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED ANSWER GENERATION

Utilization of Retrieved Information. Utilizing the retrieved information $\psi ( q ; \hat { \mathcal { D } } )$ , our LightRAGemploys a general-purpose LLM to generate answers based on the collected data. This data comprisesconcatenated values $V$ from relevant entities and relations, produced by the profiling function $\mathrm { P } ( \cdot )$ . Itincludes names, descriptions of entities and relations, and excerpts from the original text.

Context Integration and Answer Generation. By unifying the query with this multi-source text,the LLM generates informative answers tailored to the user’s needs, ensuring alignment with thequery’s intent. This approach streamlines the answer generation process by integrating both contextand query into the LLM model, as illustrated in detailed examples (Appendix 7.2).

# 3.4 COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS OF THE LIGHTRAG FRAMEWORK

In this section, we analyze the complexity of our proposed LightRAG framework, which can bedivided into two main parts. The first part is the graph-based Index phase. During this phase, we usethe large language model (LLM) to extract entities and relationships from each chunk of text. Asa result, the LLM needs to be called total tokens times. Importantly, there is no additional overheadinvolved in this process, making our approach highly efficient in managing updates to new text.

The second part of the process involves the graph-based retrieval phase. For each query, we firstutilize the large language model (LLM) to generate relevant keywords. Similar to current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems Gao et al. (2023; 2022); Chan et al. (2024), our retrievalmechanism relies on vector-based search. However, instead of retrieving chunks as in conventionalRAG, we concentrate on retrieving entities and relationships. This approach markedly reducesretrieval overhead compared to the community-based traversal method used in GraphRAG.

# 4 EVALUATION

We conduct empirical evaluations on benchmark data to assess the effectiveness of the proposedLightRAG framework by addressing the following research questions: • (RQ1): How does LightRAGcompare to existing RAG baseline methods in terms of generation performance? • (RQ2): How dodual-level retrieval and graph-based indexing enhance the generation quality of LightRAG? • (RQ3):What specific advantages does LightRAG demonstrate through case examples in various scenarios? •(RQ4): What are the costs associated with LightRAG, as well as its adaptability to data changes?

# 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS

Evaluation Datasets. To conduct a comprehensive analysis of LightRAG, we selected four datasetsfrom the UltraDomain benchmark (Qian et al., 2024). The UltraDomain data is sourced from 428college textbooks and encompasses 18 distinct domains, including agriculture, social sciences, andhumanities. From these, we chose the Agriculture, CS, Legal, and Mix datasets. Each dataset containsbetween 600,000 and 5,000,000 tokens, with detailed information provided in Table 4. Below is aspecific introduction to the four domains utilized in our experiments:

• Agriculture: This domain focuses on agricultural practices, covering a range of topics includingbeekeeping, hive management, crop production, and disease prevention.

• CS: This domain focuses on computer science and encompasses key areas of data science andsoftware engineering. It particularly highlights machine learning and big data processing, featuringcontent on recommendation systems, classification algorithms, and real-time analytics using Spark.

• Legal: This domain centers on corporate legal practices, addressing corporate restructuring, legalagreements, regulatory compliance, and governance, with a focus on the legal and financial sectors.

• Mixed: This domain presents a rich variety of literary, biographical, and philosophical texts,spanning a broad spectrum of disciplines, including cultural, historical, and philosophical studies.

Question Generation. To evaluate the effectiveness of RAG systems for high-level sensemakingtasks, we consolidate all text content from each dataset as context and adopt the generation methodoutlined in Edge et al. (2024). Specifically, we instruct an LLM to generate five RAG users, alongwith five tasks for each user. Each generated user is accompanied by a textual description detailingtheir expertise and traits that motivate their question-raising activities. Each user task is also described,emphasizing one of the user’s potential intentions when interacting with RAG systems. For eachuser-task combination, the LLM generates five questions that require an understanding of the entirecorpus. In total, this process results in 125 questions for each dataset.

Baselines. LightRAG is compared against the following state-of-the-art methods across all datasets:

• Naive RAG (Gao et al., 2023): This model serves as a standard baseline in existing RAG systems.It segments raw texts into chunks and stores them in a vector database using text embeddings. Forqueries, Naive RAG generates vectorized representations to directly retrieve text chunks based onthe highest similarity in their representations, ensuring efficient and straightforward matching.

• RQ-RAG (Chan et al., 2024): This approach leverages the LLM to decompose the input queryinto multiple sub-queries. These sub-queries are designed to enhance search accuracy by utilizingexplicit techniques such as rewriting, decomposition, and disambiguation.

• HyDE (Gao et al., 2022): This method utilizes the LLM to generate a hypothetical document basedon the input query. This generated document is then employed to retrieve relevant text chunks,which are subsequently used to formulate the final answer.

• GraphRAG (Edge et al., 2024): This is a graph-enhanced RAG system that utilizes an LLM toextract entities and relationships from the text, representing them as nodes and edges. It generatescorresponding descriptions for these elements, aggregates nodes into communities, and produces acommunity report to capture global information. When handling high-level queries, GraphRAGretrieves more comprehensive information by traversing these communities.

Implementation and Evaluation Details. In our experiments, we utilize the nano vector databasefor vector data management and access. For all LLM-based operations in LightRAG, we defaultto using GPT-4o-mini. To ensure consistency, the chunk size is set to 1200 across all datasets.Additionally, the gleaning parameter is fixed at 1 for both GraphRAG and LightRAG.

Defining ground truth for many RAG queries, particularly those involving complex high-levelsemantics, poses significant challenges. To address this, we build on existing work (Edge et al.,2024) and adopt an LLM-based multi-dimensional comparison method. We employ a robust LLM,specifically GPT-4o-mini, to rank each baseline against our LightRAG. The evaluation prompt weused is detailed in Appendix 7.3.4. In total, we utilize four evaluation dimensions, including:

i) Comprehensiveness: How thoroughly does the answer address all aspects and details of thequestion? ii) Diversity: How varied and rich is the answer in offering different perspectives andinsights related to the question? iii) Empowerment: How effectively does the answer enable thereader to understand the topic and make informed judgments? iv) Overall: This dimension assessesthe cumulative performance across the three preceding criteria to identify the best overall answer.

The LLM directly compares two answers for each dimension and selects the superior response foreach criterion. After identifying the winning answer for the three dimensions, the LLM combines theresults to determine the overall better answer. To ensure a fair evaluation and mitigate the potentialbias that could arise from the order in which the answers are presented in the prompt, we alternate theplacement of each answer. We calculate win rates accordingly, ultimately leading to the final results.

# 4.2 COMPARISON OF LIGHTRAG WITH EXISTING RAG METHODS (RQ1)

We compare LightRAG against each baseline across various evaluation dimensions and datasets. Theresults are presented in Table 1. Based on these findings, we draw the following conclusions:

The Superiority of Graph-enhanced RAG Systems in Large-Scale Corpora When handling largetoken counts and complex queries that require a thorough understanding of the dataset’s context,graph-based RAG systems like LightRAG and GraphRAG consistently outperform purely chunk-based retrieval methods such as NaiveRAG, HyDE, and RQRAG. This performance gap becomesparticularly pronounced as the dataset size increases. For instance, in the largest dataset (Legal), thedisparity widens significantly, with baseline methods achieving only about $20 \%$ win rates comparedto the dominance of LightRAG. This trend underscores the advantages of graph-enhanced RAGsystems in capturing complex semantic dependencies within large-scale corpora, facilitating a morecomprehensive understanding of knowledge and leading to improved generalization performance.

Enhancing Response Diversity with LightRAG: Compared to various baselines, LightRAG demon-strates a significant advantage in the Diversity metric, particularly within the larger Legal dataset.Its consistent lead in this area underscores LightRAG’s effectiveness in generating a wider rangeof responses, especially in scenarios where diverse content is essential. We attribute this advantageto LightRAG’s dual-level retrieval paradigm, which facilitates comprehensive information retrievalfrom both low-level and high-level dimensions. This approach effectively leverages graph-based textindexing to consistently capture the full context in response to queries.

LightRAG’s Superiority over GraphRAG: While both LightRAG and GraphRAG use graph-basedretrieval mechanisms, LightRAG consistently outperforms GraphRAG, particularly in larger datasetswith complex language contexts. In the Agriculture, CS, and Legal datasets—each containing millionsof tokens—LightRAG shows a clear advantage, significantly surpassing GraphRAG and highlightingits strength in comprehensive information understanding within diverse environments. EnhancedResponse Variety: By integrating low-level retrieval of specific entities with high-level retrieval ofbroader topics, LightRAG boosts response diversity. This dual-level mechanism effectively addressesboth detailed and abstract queries, ensuring a thorough grasp of information. Complex QueryHandling: This approach is especially valuable in scenarios requiring diverse perspectives. Byaccessing both specific details and overarching themes, LightRAG adeptly responds to complexqueries involving interconnected topics, providing contextually relevant answers.

# 4.3 ABLATION STUDIES (RQ2)

We also conduct ablation studies to evaluate the impact of our dual-level retrieval paradigm and theeffectiveness of our graph-based text indexing in LightRAG. The results are presented in Table 2.

Effectiveness of Dual-level Retrieval Paradigm. We begin by analyzing the effects of low-level andhigh-level retrieval paradigms. We compare two ablated models—each omitting one module—againstLightRAG across four datasets. Here are our key observations for the different variants:

• Low-level-only Retrieval: The -High variant removes high-order retrieval, leading to a significantperformance decline across nearly all datasets and metrics. This drop is mainly due to its emphasison the specific information, which focuses excessively on entities and their immediate neighbors.While this approach enables deeper exploration of directly related entities, it struggles to gatherinformation for complex queries that demand comprehensive insights.

• High-level-only Retrieval: The -Low variant prioritizes capturing a broader range of content byleveraging entity-wise relationships rather than focusing on specific entities. This approach offersa significant advantage in comprehensiveness, allowing it to gather more extensive and variedinformation. However, the trade-off is a reduced depth in examining specific entities, which canlimit its ability to provide highly detailed insights. Consequently, this high-level-only retrievalmethod may struggle with tasks that require precise, detailed answers.

• Hybrid Mode: The hybrid mode, or the full version of LightRAG, combines the strengths ofboth low-level and high-level retrieval methods. It retrieves a broader set of relationships whilesimultaneously conducting an in-depth exploration of specific entities. This dual-level approachensures both breadth in the retrieval process and depth in the analysis, providing a comprehensiveview of the data. As a result, LightRAG achieves balanced performance across multiple dimensions.

Semantic Graph Excels in RAG. We eliminated the use of original text in our retrieval process.Surprisingly, the resulting variant, -Origin, does not exhibit significant performance declines acrossall four datasets. In some cases, this variant even shows improvements (e.g. in Agriculture and Mix).We attribute this phenomenon to the effective extraction of key information during the graph-basedindexing process, which provides sufficient context for answering queries. Additionally, the originaltext often contains irrelevant information that can introduce noise in the response.

To provide a clear comparison between baseline methods and our LightRAG, we present specificcase examples in Table 3, which includes responses to a machine learning question from boththe competitive baseline, GraphRAG, and our LightRAG framework. In this instance, LightRAGoutperforms in all evaluation dimensions assessed by the LLM judge, including comprehensiveness,diversity, empowerment, and overall quality. Our key observations are as follows:

i) Comprehensiveness. Notably, LightRAG covers a broader range of machine learning metrics,showcasing its comprehensiveness and ability to effectively discover relevant information. Thishighlights the strength of our graph-based indexing paradigm, which excels in precise entity andrelation extraction as well as LLM profiling. ii) Both Diversity and Empowerment. Furthermore,LightRAG not only offers a more diverse array of information but also delivers more empoweringcontent. This success is due to LightRAG’s hierarchical retrieval paradigm, which combines in-depth

# 4.5 MODEL COST AND ADAPTABILITY ANALYSIS (RQ4)

We compare the cost of our LightRAG with that of thetop-performing baseline, GraphRAG, from two keyperspectives. First, we examine the number of tokensand API calls during the indexing and retrieval pro-cesses. Second, we analyze these metrics in relationto handling data changes in dynamic environments.The results of this evaluation on the legal dataset arepresented in Table 2. In this context, $T _ { \mathrm { e x t r a c t } }$ repre-sents the token overhead for entity and relationship eof tokens allowed per API call, and $C _ { \mathrm { e x t r a c t } }$ indicates t


Figure 2: Comparison of Cost in Terms of To-kens and API Calls for GraphRAG and Ligh-tRAG on the Legal Dataset.


<table><tr><td>Phase</td><td colspan="2">Retrieval Phase</td><td colspan="2">Incremental Text Update</td></tr><tr><td>Model</td><td>GraphRAG</td><td>Ours</td><td>GraphRAG</td><td>Ours</td></tr><tr><td>Tokens</td><td>610 × 1,000</td><td>&lt; 100</td><td>1,399 × 2 × 5,000 +Textract</td><td>Textract</td></tr><tr><td>API Calls</td><td>610 × 1,000 /Cmax</td><td>1</td><td>1,399 × 2 + Cextract</td><td>Cextract</td></tr></table>

In the retrieval phase, GraphRAG generates 1,399 communities, with 610 level-2 communitiesactively utilized for retrieval in this experiment. Each community report averages 1,000 tokens,resulting in a total token consumption of 610,000 tokens (610 communities $\times \ 1 { , } 0 0 0$ tokens percommunity). Additionally, GraphRAG’s requirement to traverse each community individually leadsto hundreds of API calls, significantly increasing retrieval overhead. In contrast, LightRAG optimizesthis process by using fewer than 100 tokens for keyword generation and retrieval, requiring only asingle API call for the entire process. This efficiency is achieved through our retrieval mechanism,

which seamlessly integrates graph structures and vectorized representations for information retrieval,thereby eliminating the need to process large volumes of information upfront.

In the incremental data update phase, designed to address changes in dynamic real-world scenarios,both models exhibit similar overhead for entity and relationship extraction. However, GraphRAGshows significant inefficiency in managing newly added data. When a new dataset of the samesize as the legal dataset is introduced, GraphRAG must dismantle its existing community structureto incorporate new entities and relationships, followed by complete regeneration. This processincurs a substantial token cost of approximately 5,000 tokens per community report. Given 1,399communities, GraphRAG would require around $1 , 3 9 9 \times 2 \times 5 , 0 0 0$ tokens to reconstruct both theoriginal and new community reports—an exorbitant expense that underscores its inefficiency. Incontrast, LightRAG seamlessly integrates newly extracted entities and relationships into the existinggraph without the need for full reconstruction. This approach results in significantly lower overheadduring incremental updates, demonstrating its superior efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

# 5 RELATED WORK

# 5.1 RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION WITH LLMS

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLM inputs by retrieving relevant infor-mation from external sources, grounding responses in factual, domain-specific knowledge Ram et al.(2023); Fan et al. (2024). Current RAG approaches Gao et al. (2022; 2023); Chan et al. (2024); Yuet al. (2024) typically embed queries in a vector space to find the nearest context vectors. However,many of these methods rely on fragmented text chunks and only retrieve the top-k contexts, limitingtheir ability to capture comprehensive global information needed for effective responses.

Although recent studies Edge et al. (2024) have explored using graph structures for knowledgerepresentation, two key limitations persist. First, these approaches often lack the capability fordynamic updates and expansions of the knowledge graph, making it difficult to incorporate newinformation effectively. In contrast, our proposed model, LightRAG, addresses these challengesby enabling the RAG system to quickly adapt to new information, ensuring the model’s timelinessand accuracy. Additionally, existing methods often rely on brute-force searches for each generatedcommunity, which are inefficient for large-scale queries. Our LightRAG framework overcomes thislimitation by facilitating rapid retrieval of relevant information from the graph through our proposeddual-level retrieval paradigm, significantly enhancing both retrieval efficiency and response speed.

# 5.2 LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL FOR GRAPHS

Graphs are a powerful framework for representing complex relationships and find applicationsin numerous fields. As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, researchers haveincreasingly focused on enhancing their capability to interpret graph-structured data. This body ofwork can be divided into three primary categories: i) GNNs as Prefix where Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) are utilized as the initial processing layer for graph data, generating structure-aware tokensthat LLMs can use during inference. Notable examples include GraphGPT Tang et al. (2024) andLLaGA Chen et al. (2024). ii) LLMs as Prefix involves LLMs processing graph data enriched withtextual information to produce node embeddings or labels, ultimately refining the training processfor GNNs, as demonstrated in systems like GALM Xie et al. (2023) and OFA Liu et al. (2024). iii)LLMs-Graphs Integration focuses on achieving a seamless interaction between LLMs and graphdata, employing techniques such as fusion training and GNN alignment, and developing LLM-basedagents capable of engaging with graph information directly Li et al. (2023); Brannon et al. (2023).

# 6 CONCLUSION

This work introduces an advancement in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) through theintegration of a graph-based indexing approach that enhances both efficiency and comprehensionin information retrieval. LightRAG utilizes a comprehensive knowledge graph to facilitate rapidand relevant document retrieval, enabling a deeper understanding of complex queries. Its dual-levelretrieval paradigm allows for the extraction of both specific and abstract information, catering todiverse user needs. Furthermore, LightRAG’s seamless incremental update capability ensures thatthe system remains current and responsive to new information, thereby maintaining its effectivenessover time. Overall, LightRAG excels in both efficiency and effectiveness, significantly improving thespeed and quality of information retrieval and generation while reducing costs for LLM inference.

In Figure 3, we illustrate the retrieve-and-generate process. When presented with the query, “Whatmetrics are most informative for evaluating movie recommendation systems?”, the LLM first extractsboth low-level and high-level keywords. These keywords guide the dual-level retrieval process on the

generated knowledge graph, targeting relevant entities and relationships. The retrieved informationis organized into three components: entities, relationships, and corresponding text chunks. Thisstructured data is then fed into the LLM, enabling it to generate a comprehensive answer to the query.

# 7.4 CASE STUDY: COMPARISON BETWEEN LIGHTRAG AND THE BASELINE NAIVERAG.

To further illustrate LightRAG’s superiority over baseline models in terms of comprehensiveness,empowerment, and diversity, we present a case study comparing LightRAG and NaiveRAG inTable 5. This study addresses a question regarding indigenous perspectives in the context of corporatemergers. Notably, LightRAG offers a more in-depth exploration of key themes related to indigenousperspectives, such as cultural significance, collaboration, and legal frameworks, supported by specificand illustrative examples. In contrast, while NaiveRAG provides informative responses, it lacksthe depth needed to thoroughly examine the various dimensions of indigenous ownership andcollaboration. The dual-level retrieval process employed by LightRAG enables a more comprehensiveinvestigation of specific entities and their interrelationships, facilitating extensive searches thateffectively capture overarching themes and complexities within the topic.
